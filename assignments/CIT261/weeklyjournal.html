        <h2>Weekly Journal</h2>
        <br>
        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p ul class="sec1">: This week went pretty well.  Same as usual.  Lots of getting to know you activities and syllabus review.  It was a pretty standard week.  I was excited to hear Brother Thayne talk about how this is not a programming class.  I have struggled in the past with those.  It is not my favorite.  Hopefully it works out okay.  <br>
        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p ul class="sec1">This week was good.  We got put into groups and I met with my group for the first time.  They seem like great people.  Breanna will be a big help, she is very excited about the class and really on top of things.  I am starting to understand the format a bit.  It seems pretty similar to the web back end development class I took.  Hopefully I will do well.</p>
        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p ul class="sec1">.  I submitted my first two Fluency reviews this week.  I am not exactly sure it is what Brother Thayne is looking for, but I am hopeful.  I want to press forward and work on more topics, but I am waiting to hear back to see if I need to make any changes to my thinking.  I am hopeful things will go well.   </p>
        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p ul class="sec1">.  This week was a good one.  I submitted another fluency review for Json.  Breanna was removed from our group, so it is just Eric and I.  We seem to work well together so I am grateful for the change.  I haven’t heard back on the first couple fluency reviews, but I seem to be on the same page with Eric, so hopefully this is what Brother Thayne is looking for.  It is a tough format of the class to teach yourself, but I will persevere.   </p>
        <h2>Week 5</h2>
        <p ul class="sec1">.  Everything went well this week.  The coding topics I worked on (AJAX & Local Storage) were fairly simple.  I still have not got any feedback on my submitted topics, but I hope to hear back soon.  It was been a god class so far.  Eric and I are working well together and hope to do well in the class.  So far so good.  </p>
        <h2>Week 6</h2>
        <p ul class="sec1">.  This week went really well.  I worked on DOM and CSS manipulation.  I already had a really good handle on CSS having used it in other courses.  It was cool to see how I can apply JavaScript to make changes to the CSS.  The DOM also seemed fairly basic.  The whole week went very well.  No complaints.  I still haven’t gotten any feedback on my submitted assignments but I am hopeful.    </p>
        <h2>Week 7</h2>
        <p ul class="sec1">.  This week was a good one.  I worked on CSS transitions and also calling changes using java.  It was fun to see how you can use the different tools to make visual changes to your site and graphics.  Everything went well with the group.  We were able to meet and go over each other’s progress.  We both seem to be on track to getting it all done.  I also got my first feedback this weekend.  It was good to see that I am submitting what the teacher is looking for.   </p>
        <h2>Week 8</h2>
        <p ul class="sec1">. This week went fairly well.  I added my journal to the web page and aslo worked on my html5 tags.  No problems or frustrations with the code.  Everything is coming together nicely.  Brother Thayne mentioned he will have the rest of the fluency reviews graded this week so I am nervous and excited.  All is good.  </p>
        <h2>Week 9</h2>
        <p ul class="sec1">. Week 9 went fairly well.  I completed all of the assigned topics today and will submit my last fluency review tomorrow after meeting with Eric.  I am excited to have them all done and get in a place where I should pass the class.  I had a bit of trouble with the animations, I couldn't get the js to work correctly but finally got it figured out.  All in all it was a good week and I look forward to getting the feedback and looking forward to a mobile app.  </p>
